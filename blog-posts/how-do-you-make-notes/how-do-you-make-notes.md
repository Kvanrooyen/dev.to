I recently wrote a post titled ["Why I use Markdown to take notes"](https://dev.to/kvanrooyen/why-i-use-markdown-to-take-notes-5fpl), the tl;dr is: I started using Markdown for meeting notes, and the benefits for me. Now I come to you with the question, how do you take notes?

Let me give you an example: You are working as normal, and then someone says something important to you. This is something you either need to complete or make note of for the future.
How would you take note of that? For me, I have post-it notes, and I will write the note on them. I then stick it on my desk in front of me. I have also tried using a To-Do application, like [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/).
I guess I am trying to find a happy medium between the two :man_shrugging:
