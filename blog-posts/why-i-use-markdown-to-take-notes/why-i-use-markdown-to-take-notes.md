This is my first article, so please go gentle on me, but I wanted to talk about why I started using Markdown to take notes.

## Why Markdown?

Before I started using Markdown, I used to take notes in [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app?rtc=1). Why wouldn't I? It was cross-platform, it synced my notes across devices, and it was familiar. I started using it to take notes in my meetings, and it worked ok. I could take the notes, and then I could send them as a message later in our group chat.
