This is my first article, so please go gentle on me, but I wanted to talk about why I started using Markdown to take notes.

## Why Markdown

Before I started using Markdown, I used to take notes in [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app?rtc=1). Why wouldn't I? It was cross-platform, it synced my notes across devices, and it was familiar. I started using it to take notes in my meetings, and it worked ok. I could take the notes, and then I could send them as a message later in our group chat. My issue came in the form of me spending too much time worrying about the formatting and then after the meeting I would need to formatt the notes again. When I send the messages on our group chat, I can use a small amount of Markdown.

After using OneNote for about a week of taking notes, I decided that I would try using Markdown. I had some experience with Markdown from GitHub, so I felt comfortable taking notes with it. Markdown seemed like it would help solve my "issues", since I could quickly format the notes (Mainly bolding important things), and focus on taking better notes.

## Choosing and editor

When it came to choosing a Markdown editor, I had 2 main requirements:

- Open Source
- Simple and distraction free design

I came across some great looking editors, most of which I can't remember now. Eventually I decided on using [Mark Text](https://github.com/marktext/marktext), it was almost perfect out the box. I only changed a couple small things before I started using it. I changed the default theme, the font size and have it open a specific folder on launch.
