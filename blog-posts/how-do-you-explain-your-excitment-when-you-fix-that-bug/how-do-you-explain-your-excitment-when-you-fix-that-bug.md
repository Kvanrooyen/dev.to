I hope the title makes sense because this is something I have been thinking about for a little while now. You know that feeling when you finally get that bug, and it turned out to be something relatively simple. You've spent hours Googling, and browsing Stack Overflow, and then when you finally get it fixed, that feeling. How do you explain that to someone who isn't a developer or even someone who doesn't know much about IT? If I had to try and explain that to my grandparents or even my parents, they would probably look at me like I'm crazy :joy:
